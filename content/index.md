# welcome to lju-lug

lju-lug stands for lj university linux users group. we're a group of friends who love Linux, open-source software, and Unix-like environments. it all started as just us geeking out over tech, but then we thoughtâ€”why not bring more people in? why not create a space where everyone can share ideas, learn together, and make something awesome? so here we are, turning our little circle into a whirlpool of ideas and collaboration. whether you're a seasoned hacker or just getting started, you're welcome here!

## meetings

we get together regularly to chat about Linux, open source, and whatever cool tech we've been tinkering with. sometimes we deep-dive into new tools, other times we just hang out and troubleshoot each other's weird system issues. it's always fun!

## get involved

- check out our [posts](posts.html) for updates on what we're up to.
- star us on [github](https://github.com/dhrm1k/lju-lug) to see what we're building and hacking on.
- got a project or idea? bring it to the group, we love collaborating!
- join our [WhatsApp group](https://chat.whatsapp.com/H8efN3bENZE9vz2Dsfeeu6) to stay connected.
- find us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/aKqUrJBk). we wanted to use irc instead, but we also want this place to be inclusive, and not a lot of people understand irc. this way, more people can join in easily! if wanted we will host our own irc server :)
- if you're on the fediverse, we have our self-hosted snac instance at [linuxusers.in](https://linuxusers.in) (yay, we own that domain. it's a sick domain). ping us if you want to join!

come say hi, we'd love to meet you!
