# why lju-lug exists?

the idea behind lju-lug wasn't planned—it just happened. we are a bunch of friends, passionate about linux and open-source, constantly tinkering with our systems, troubleshooting issues, and sharing knowledge in our small circles. for the longest time, it was just us, chatting in our whatsapp group and on linuxusers.in, exchanging ideas, and helping each other out.

but then we thought—why keep it limited? there are so many others out there who might be looking for a community like this. people who love linux, who want to learn, who want to build something cool, or who just want to be around others who get why foss matters. so instead of just being a closed circle, we decided to open things up and bring more people in.

this space is for everyone. whether you're someone who compiles their own kernel or someone who's just installed their first linux distro, you're welcome here. we talk about everything—customizing workflows, self-hosting, hacking on side projects, and just enjoying the freedom that open-source software brings. and most importantly, we help each other out.

for the same reason, i started [linuxusers.in](https://dhrm1k.github.io/snac-server.html)—to have a place where a few people could talk about their ideas, share knowledge, and interact. 

so, lju-lug exists because we wanted a place where linux users at lj university (and beyond) could connect, share, and build. and if you're reading this, that means you're part of it too. welcome.
